Kernel Driver used for Reading and Writing to user-space memory from Kernel Mode. It uses MmCopyVirtualMemory to transfer the data UM<->KM. The driver allows remove himself from a PC while stays loaded (that's bypassing Win10 func to block deleting loaded drivers - PatchGuard safe!) For now this should be UD on almost every non-bootloaded ACs (that's for sure detected on FaceIT/ESEA - you have to use another method to transfer data and bootload your driver and probably not using any UM apps at all (do everything from Kernel instead))
